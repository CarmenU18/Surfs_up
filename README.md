# Weather analysis for Surf & Ice-cream shop

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide concrete data to make the decision to open a surf and ice cream store is sustainable all year round. Specifically, temperature data was analyzed for the months of June and December on Oahu, an island in Hawaii.

## Results

- The analyzed data were collected from 9 stations on the island of Oahu from 2020 to 2107.

- In order to understand the year's weather conditions we focused on collecting data at mid-year and year-end (June and December).

- Comparing the data, in June the weather is better with an average temperature of 75 with a minimum of 64 and a maximum of 85 compared to December we see a reduction of the average temperature of 4 degrees and if we compare the minimum temperatures we have a difference of 8 degrees less, while for maximum temperatures this difference is reduced to only 2 degrees difference.

- The percentile statistics show the same trend in temperature reduction in the month of December vs. June.

- Although the data show a reduction in temperature, they remain very close to the average, so it can be assumed that the data are symmetrical.

## Summary

In summary, we can say that although in the month of December there is a drop in temperature, this difference is not really significant, and even with 4 degrees less the weather is still ideal for surfing or having an ice cream.

The analysis period from 2010 to 2017 gives us the guideline to affirm that the data is reliable to be able to make the decision to open the surf and ice cream store and that during the year the weather is not going to be a negative factor in sales.

Climate data is an important factor in decision making but we could also include additional data to support the decision, for example:

- 1. If we add the precipitation data for the months of study, rainfall is a factor that can affect our previous decision. 

- 2. Analyzing the temperature and precipitation by season, although on average we do not see a significant variation, analyzing individually could give us more detail of which area has a better climate with lower probability of precipitation and therefore the best area to open the surf and ice cream store.
